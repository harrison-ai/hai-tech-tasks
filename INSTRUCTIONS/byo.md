![https://xkcd.com/927/](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

## Description

Had enough of the silly code tests companies cook up on a whim? We've got a problem for you.

Send us some code _you've already written_ that you're proud of.

## What kind of code?

Most importantly it should be a piece of work where you're the primary author and have full rights to share the source.

It might be an interesting problem you've solved, open source contributions or a pet-project you've been hacking away at on the side.

We suggest you choose something:
- easy to explain
- you can run a live demo with
- demonstrates skills and technology relevant to your role
- that's fun or interesting 
- shows quality engineering, even if it's not production ready

If you have a portfolio of multiple projects to share let us know which to focus on in the review session.

## Solution shape

Please provide a link to a github repo and any supporting materials.

If the code is private, we can provide github handles for share-back.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions about the process or whether a certain project might be a good candidate for sharing.
